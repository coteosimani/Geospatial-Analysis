## Overview
This project analyzes the prevalence and spatial distribution of sexual street harassment in Santiago, Chile, using survey data and geospatial analysis.  
Research questions:
- What proportion of women experience street harassment in each municipality?
- Is there spatial correlation in harassment cases?

---

## Data
- **Survey:** ENVIF-VCM (2017 & 2020, Region 13), n = 2,440 women.  
- **Spatial:** Municipality shapefiles for urban Santiago.

---

## Methods
- Descriptive statistics on prevalence by municipality and harassment type.  
- Spatial autocorrelation: Global & Local Moranâ€™s I.  
- R packages: `tidyverse`, `sf`, `spdep`, `tmap`.

---

## Findings
- ~40% of women reported harassment; 45% first experienced it before age 14.  
- Harassment occurs across neighborhoods, public transport, and streets.  
- No significant global spatial autocorrelation; slight concentration in central areas.

---

## Conclusion
Harassment is widespread across Santiago. Prevention policies should focus on **micro-spatial factors** like lighting and police presence.
